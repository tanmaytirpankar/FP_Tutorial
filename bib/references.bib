abstract = {This article presents GRAM (GPU-based Runtime Adaption for Mixed-precision) a framework for the effective use of mixed precision arithmetic for CUDA programs. Our method provides a fine-grain tradeoff between output error and performance. It can create many variants that satisfy different accuracy requirements by assigning different groups of threads to different precision levels adaptively at runtime. To widen the range of applications that can benefit from its approximation, GRAM comes with an optional half-precision approximate math library. Using GRAM, we can trade off precision for any performance improvement of up to 540%, depending on the application and accuracy requirement.},
